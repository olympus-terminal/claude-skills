Help debug the issue: $ARGUMENTS

Steps:
1. Gather information about the issue:
   - Error messages or unexpected behavior description
   - Relevant log output
   - Steps to reproduce if known
2. Form hypotheses about potential causes
3. Investigate systematically:
   - Read relevant source files
   - Check recent changes with git log/diff
   - Look for similar issues in the codebase
   - Search for related error patterns
4. For each hypothesis:
   - Explain the theory
   - Suggest how to verify it
   - Provide debugging steps or code
5. Propose solutions in order of likelihood
6. Offer to implement the most likely fix
